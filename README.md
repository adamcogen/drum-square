# Drum Square #

This project implements a simple drum machine that uses a bouncing ball inside a rectangle to determine when drum sounds should be triggered. A different drum sound plays based on which edge of the rectangle the ball bounces off of, with the following orientation:

- Bottom edge: bass drum
- Left edge: high hi-hat
- Rigth edge: low hi-hat
- Top edge: snare

I mostly wrote this as a way to learn Javascript, but it's also fun to mess around with and can produce unusual drum patterns that most other drum machines wouldn't be able to replicate.
